Yes, you can generate a graphical representation of the Bayesian Network using libraries such as `networkx` and `matplotlib` in Python. Here’s how you can visualize the Bayesian Network defined in the previous steps:

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries

If you haven't already, install the `networkx` and `matplotlib` libraries:

```sh
pip install networkx matplotlib
```

### Step 2: Define and Visualize the Bayesian Network

Here’s the complete code to define and visualize the Bayesian Network:

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pgmpy.models import BayesianNetwork
from pgmpy.factors.discrete import TabularCPD

# Define the structure of the Bayesian Network
model = BayesianNetwork([
    ('NumCards_Hearts', 'Bid_Hearts'),
    ('HighValue_Hearts', 'Bid_Hearts'),
    ('NumCards_Spades', 'Bid_Spades'),
    ('HighValue_Spades', 'Bid_Spades'),
    # Add more nodes and dependencies as needed
])

# Example CPTs
cpd_numcards_hearts = TabularCPD(variable='NumCards_Hearts', variable_card=5,
                                 values=[[0.1], [0.2], [0.3], [0.3], [0.1]])

cpd_highvalue_hearts = TabularCPD(variable='HighValue_Hearts', variable_card=2,
                                  values=[[0.6], [0.4]])

cpd_bid_hearts = TabularCPD(variable='Bid_Hearts', variable_card=2,
                            values=[[0.7, 0.2, 0.1, 0.5, 0.3, 0.1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.5, 0.2],
                                    [0.3, 0.8, 0.9, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 0.7, 0.9, 0.5, 0.8]],
                            evidence=['NumCards_Hearts', 'HighValue_Hearts'],
                            evidence_card=[5, 2])

# Add the CPTs to the model
model.add_cpds(cpd_numcards_hearts, cpd_highvalue_hearts, cpd_bid_hearts)

# Check the model for any inconsistencies
model.check_model()

# Visualize the Bayesian Network
def plot_bayesian_network(model):
    G = nx.DiGraph()
    
    for node in model.nodes():
        G.add_node(node)
    
    for edge in model.edges():
        G.add_edge(edge[0], edge[1])
    
    pos = nx.spring_layout(G)
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    nx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_size=3000, node_color='lightblue', font_size=10, font_weight='bold', arrowsize=20)
    plt.title('Bayesian Network')
    plt.show()

# Plot the Bayesian Network
plot_bayesian_network(model)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Define the Bayesian Network**: The `model` object represents the Bayesian Network with nodes and edges.
2. **Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs)**: Example CPTs are added to the model.
3. **Check the Model**: Ensure that the model is consistent using `check_model()`.
4. **Plotting the Network**: The `plot_bayesian_network` function creates a directed graph using `networkx` and plots it using `matplotlib`.

### Running the Code

- Ensure that you have all necessary libraries installed (`pgmpy`, `networkx`, `matplotlib`).
- Run the script to visualize the Bayesian Network.

This script will create a graphical representation of the Bayesian Network, showing the nodes and the directed edges that represent the dependencies between the variables. You can extend this script by adding more nodes and edges as needed for your specific model.
